# Encoder/Decoder

This program is able to take in three arguments.
1. The message you want to encode or decode.
2. "encode" to encode the message, "decode" to decode the message.
3. How many letters you would like your encoded message shifted by or how many letters you need your encoded message to be shifted by to decode it.

The message can contain any letter, number, space, or special characters, and is case sensitive(meaning it will keep it's case).

Currently, it isset to shift by the day of the month, and also print the number of the day of the month in the test.
